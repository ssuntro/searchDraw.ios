# Problem statement
In the software engineering field, different Excalidraw diagrams are used for various projects or features to document low-level technical designs. Often, requirement is to locate a specific component, such as "Service A," and determine which project or feature it belongs to.

It would be highly beneficial to have a search capability that allows users to search for text across multiple Excalidraw files. This feature would improve efficiency in navigating and retrieving relevant technical design information.
