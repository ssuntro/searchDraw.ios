# Problem statement

In software engineering, various draw.io diagrams are used across different projects or features to document low-level technical designs. Often, there is a need to find a specific component, such as "Service A," and identify the project or feature it is associated with.

A search functionality that enables users to look for text across multiple draw.io files would be extremely useful.
Hereâ€™s a shell script that might help enhance efficiency in navigating and retrieving relevant technical design information. Hope it proves helpful!

# How to use the script
1. collect all draw.io files in single directory(location)
2. download search_drawio.sh
3. open macos terminal and go to directory that the downloaded script located
4. allow the script to be executed in terminal `chmod +x search_drawio.sh`
5. execute the script `./search_drawio.sh`
6. input the directory of 1. or get it from run `pwd` in terminal
7. input the searching text without double quote.
8. get the result
