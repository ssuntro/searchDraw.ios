# Problem statement

In the software engineering field, different Excalidraw diagrams are used for various projects or features to document low-level technical designs. Often, requirement is to locate a specific component, such as "Service A," and determine which project or feature it belongs to.

It would be highly beneficial to have a search capability that allows users to search for text across multiple Excalidraw files. This feature would improve efficiency in navigating and retrieving relevant technical design information.

# How to use the script
1. collect all draw.io files in single directory(location)
2. download search_drawio.sh
3. open macos terminal and go to directory that the downloaded script located
4. allow the script to be executed in terminal `chmod +x search_drawio.sh`
5. execute the script `./search_drawio.sh`
6. input the directory of 1. or get it from run `pwd` in terminal
7. input the searching text without double quote.
8. get the result
